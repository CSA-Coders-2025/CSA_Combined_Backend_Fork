For some reason, these files are showing errors, even though they function correctly. I'm not sure if this is due to an issue with the encoding that's being resolved, or if Visual Studio Code is misinterpreting them as errors. However, the files are working fine, so please don't make any changes to them unless you know how to hide the false error flagging.
