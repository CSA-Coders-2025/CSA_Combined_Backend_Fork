hi: dev of the streaming system here
this year mort told us to develop features that people of the future were to iterate on
right now the way streaming works is pretty unoptimized, everyone peerconnects to the streamer persons computer,
if we can move towards using a mediaserver to host our streams, that would be awesome!
if you want to see how to do it look up SFU
if you want to see some previous iterations i made before as of now's version (nativesocket folder),
read the archive folder, should be in a folder called "Stream" that uses an SFU
you will still need the nativesocket stuff for communicating icecandidates,
in the case you do end up innovating on this system: maybe write ur name on here and what year
legacy of webrtc trauma
thanks
